They are:

Task 1: Starting issues
- Create new issues for each task and label each of them.

Task 2: Project board 
- Name the project broad and marks some actions as done when the task is fulfiled.

Task 3: Set up readme.md (NOW haha)
- Edit the readme file to show what to finish for each task.

Task 4: Write C code
- Set up a Github Action to run a simple C program that created by yourself (can be justsimple as Hello World). 

Task 5: Get a status badge
- Edit the Code part of this readme and get a workflow status badge for the code created in task 4.

Task 6: Showcase your team 
- Edit readme but also show the information required in the task.
